SORTED AI – PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: January 16, 2025
Last Updated: January 16, 2025

1. INTRODUCTION
Sorted AI ("we," "our," or "the App") is a 100% local-first productivity assistant that automatically converts messages from WhatsApp into actionable draft tasks and calendar events—all processed entirely on your device with zero cloud uploads.
Our Core Privacy Commitment:
✅ 100% On-Device Processing – All AI analysis happens locally on your phone
✅ Zero Server Communication – Your data never leaves your device
✅ No Data Collection – We don't collect, store, or transmit any personal data externally
✅ Military-Grade Encryption – All local data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
✅ Automatic Deletion – Old messages are automatically purged (7/30/90 days or custom)
✅ Complete Transparency – You control everything; we control nothing
This Privacy Policy explains:

How the App processes data locally on your device
Why we need specific permissions (Accessibility Service, Calendar)
How your data is encrypted and automatically deleted
What we do NOT do with your information


2. WHAT DATA IS PROCESSED (LOCALLY ONLY)
2.1 WhatsApp Message Text (On-Device Only)
What the App Does:
When you enable the Accessibility Service, Sorted AI reads message text directly from WhatsApp to detect tasks, events, and reminders.
Examples of Processing:

"Meeting kal 3 baje" → Draft Event: "Meeting Tomorrow 3:00 PM"
"Pay Rohit 500 for dinner" → Draft Payment Reminder: ₹500 to Rohit
"Gym roz subah 6 baje" → Recurring Task: "Gym Daily 6:00 AM"
"Har Monday standup 10am" → Weekly Event: "Standup Every Monday 10:00 AM"

How It Works:

Reading: The App uses Android's Accessibility Service API to read text content from WhatsApp messages
Analysis: Message text is analyzed using on-device AI (no internet required)
Extraction: Relevant information is extracted (date, time, person, amount, recurrence pattern)
Draft Creation: A draft suggestion is created and shown to you for review
Your Control: You must manually Confirm, Edit, or Dismiss each draft—nothing happens automatically

Storage & Encryption:

Message text is stored in a local encrypted database (AES-256-GCM encryption)
Encryption keys are managed by Android Keystore (hardware-backed security)
Field-level encryption protects message content, sender information, and metadata
Data is inaccessible to other apps (stored in app-private directory)
Never uploaded to any server or cloud service

Automatic Deletion:
Messages are automatically deleted after your chosen retention period:

7 days (default)
30 days
90 days
Custom (minimum 2 days)

Deletion is enforced through daily scheduled cleanup that permanently removes expired data.

2.2 Calendar Events (Optional)
What the App Does:
If you grant Calendar permission, Sorted AI can:

Read your existing calendar events to detect scheduling conflicts
Write events to your calendar only when you explicitly tap "Confirm" on a draft

Examples:

Conflict Detection: "Meeting at 3 PM conflicts with existing Gym appointment"
Event Creation: Tapping "Confirm" on a draft adds it to your default calendar

Storage:

Calendar data is accessed through Android's Calendar Provider API
We do not store copies of your calendar events
Calendar access is read-only until you confirm a draft

Your Control:

You can use the App without Calendar permission (drafts won't sync to calendar)
Each draft requires your explicit confirmation before writing to calendar
No auto-sync, no background changes


2.3 App Preferences (Local Only)
What Is Stored:

Permission status (Accessibility enabled/disabled, Calendar enabled/disabled)
Message retention period (7/30/90 days or custom)
Onboarding completion status
UI preferences (language, theme settings)

Storage Location:

Android SharedPreferences (local device storage)
Never transmitted to external servers


2.4 What We DO NOT Collect
The App does not collect, access, or process:
❌ Location data – No GPS or location tracking
❌ Contacts – No access to your contact list
❌ Photos/Media – No access to your gallery or files
❌ Personal identifiers – No email addresses, phone numbers, or account IDs
❌ Device identifiers – No IMEI, Android ID, or advertising IDs
❌ Network data – No IP addresses or network requests with user data
❌ Behavioral data – No usage analytics, screen recordings, or tracking
❌ Keyboard input – No keystroke logging outside WhatsApp messages
❌ Audio/Video – No microphone or camera access
❌ Financial data – No credit card or payment information
We do not use:

❌ Analytics SDKs (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel)
❌ Advertising SDKs (AdMob, Meta Audience Network)
❌ Cloud services (Firebase, AWS, Google Cloud)
❌ AI/ML APIs (OpenAI, Google Cloud AI, any external LLMs)
❌ Crash reporting tools (Crashlytics, Sentry)
❌ Attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust)


3. HOW DATA IS PROCESSED
3.1 Core Functionality (On-Device AI)
Processing Workflow:

Message Reading: Accessibility Service reads text from WhatsApp
Local Analysis: On-device AI analyzes the text (Hinglish and English supported)
Pattern Detection: Identifies dates ("kal," "parso"), times ("3 baje"), recurrence ("roz," "har hafte")
Draft Generation: Creates a draft card with extracted information
User Review: You see the draft and choose to Confirm/Edit/Dismiss
Optional Calendar Sync: If confirmed, the event is written to your calendar

Processing Location:

All AI processing happens on your device's CPU/GPU
No network requests are made for message analysis
Works 100% offline (airplane mode compatible)


3.2 Conflict Detection
If Calendar permission is granted:

The App reads your existing calendar events
Compares draft event times with existing appointments
Warns you: "Meeting at 3 PM conflicts with Gym at 3 PM"

Privacy Note:

Calendar reading is on-demand (only when reviewing a draft)
No calendar data is stored permanently
No calendar data is transmitted externally


3.3 Data Retention & Auto-Deletion
Automatic Cleanup:

Daily scheduled task runs to delete expired messages
Deletion is based on your chosen retention period
Once deleted, data is permanently removed (not recoverable)

Manual Deletion:
You can delete all data anytime:

Open Settings → Data & Privacy
Tap "Clear All Data"
Confirm deletion

This permanently removes:

All stored message text
All draft cards
All app preferences


4. PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED
4.1 Accessibility Service ⚠️ (Primary Permission)
Why We Need It:
Android restricts apps from reading content from other apps. To detect tasks and events from WhatsApp messages, we use the Accessibility Service API to read message text directly from WhatsApp's interface.
What We Do:
✅ Read text content from WhatsApp messages
✅ Analyze text locally using on-device AI
✅ Create draft suggestions for you to review
✅ Process only WhatsApp (no other apps monitored)
✅ Respect user control (you must confirm each draft manually)
What We Do NOT Do:
❌ Control WhatsApp or send messages on your behalf
❌ Auto-confirm drafts (you must manually tap "Confirm")
❌ Record keystrokes or passwords
❌ Monitor banking apps, browsers, or other sensitive apps
❌ Access WhatsApp media (photos, videos, voice notes)
❌ Upload message text to any server or cloud service
❌ Share data with third parties
Scope Limitation:

Accessibility Service is used exclusively for reading WhatsApp message text
We do not monitor screen content from other apps
We do not capture UI events outside WhatsApp
We do not use Accessibility to perform actions (clicks, gestures) on your behalf

Compliance:
We comply with Google Play's Accessibility API Policy, which permits Accessibility Service usage for productivity features that help users organize information.
Transparency:

Permission rationale is shown before requesting access
You can disable Accessibility anytime in Settings
Disabling it stops new draft creation but preserves existing drafts


4.2 Calendar Permission (Optional)
Why We Need It:
To show your existing events for conflict detection and to write confirmed drafts to your calendar.
What We Do:
✅ Read calendar events via Android's Calendar Provider API
✅ Write events only after your explicit confirmation
✅ Detect scheduling conflicts before creating events
What We Do NOT Do:
❌ Modify existing events without your permission
❌ Delete calendar events
❌ Auto-sync drafts (you must confirm each one)
❌ Access calendar data from other apps or accounts
Your Control:

Calendar permission is entirely optional
You can use the App without Calendar access (drafts remain local)
Each calendar write requires your explicit tap on "Confirm"


4.3 Storage Permission
Why We Need It:
To save encrypted local data (message text, drafts, preferences).
What We Do:
✅ Store data in app-private directory (inaccessible to other apps)
✅ Encrypt all sensitive data with AES-256-GCM

5. DATA SECURITY
